# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Purity-directed automatic memoization
- `nx-ir` proves a function Pure; the compiler caches it automatically,
  with no annotation and no source change. Scalar arguments only, so
  list mutation stays visible. 4096-entry bounded cache, cmpxchg
  spinlock in the runtime (no pthreads, so it links on Windows too).
- Opt out with `NX_NOMEMO=1`. Interpreter `fib(30)`: 80.17s -> 0.09s;
  native `fib(90)`: 0.19s.
- Parallel worker threads get a 64 MiB stack: memoized recursion reaches
  a depth that overflowed the 2 MiB default.

### Unboxing optimizer
- Values with a statically known scalar type live in bare `i64`/`double`
  /`i1` registers and stack slots, with raw LLVM arithmetic. Boxing is
  re-inserted only at dynamic boundaries: call arguments, returns, list
  elements, module globals, `print`. Function boundaries stay boxed.
- `nx-types` now infers parameter types from the body. Uses with exactly
  one answer pin the type (`xs[i]` is `Int`, `if b` is `Bool`,
  `x < 1.5` is `Float`); a parameter used only in arithmetic is numeric
  and defaults to `Int`, matching how a numeric local is fixed by its
  first binding.
- Fixed a soundness hole the unboxing exposed: an unresolved expression
  assigned to a known-typed variable now widens that variable to
  unresolved, instead of silently keeping the narrow type.
- `nx_eq` on floats now uses IEEE comparison rather than bit equality, so
  `NaN != NaN` and `0.0 == -0.0` hold and the boxed and unboxed paths
  agree with the interpreter.
- Opt out with `NX_NOUNBOX=1`. ~6.3x faster on numeric loops, identical
  output.

### Task pool for `parallel:`
- A batch gets a pool sized to the batch instead of one thread per task.
  Workers claim task indices from a shared cursor, so a thread that
  finishes early picks up the next task instead of idling, and uneven
  tasks still balance. The calling thread works too, which saves a
  thread and guarantees the batch drains even if a spawn fails.
- The pool is per-block, not global: no process-wide mutable state,
  nothing to shut down, and no question about a pool outliving the code
  that queued work into it.
- Only the two OS bindings differ between platforms, so they moved to
  `runtime_threads_win.ll` / `runtime_threads_unix.ll`. The pool logic
  is shared and therefore tested identically everywhere.
- 8 independent tasks: 0.190s sequential -> 0.033s, a 6x speedup on 16
  logical cores (4.42x with thread-per-task), output byte-identical.
- CI now runs the parallel example 8 times and diffs, since threads make
  output order a real risk.

### Windows threaded `parallel:`
- `parallel:` batches now run on real threads on Windows instead of
  lowering sequentially, so the block means the same thing on every
  platform. 8 independent tasks: 0.193s sequential -> 0.044s, a 4.42x
  speedup on 16 logical cores, with byte-identical output.
- The HANDLE comes from `CreateThread`'s return value. Its last argument
  is `lpThreadId`, a DWORD id, and waiting on that silently failed
  every time -- which is why the first Windows build produced zeros.
- `runtime.ll` declares both platforms' threading APIs and stays
  platform-neutral: an unused declaration emits no symbol reference.
- `collect_outer_reads` and the batch emitter are no longer unix-only.
- CI asserts the generated IR actually contains spawn calls. A batch
  that quietly fell back to inline execution would still pass the
  differential test while doing no parallel work at all.

### Tooling
- `nx build --emit-ir` prints the generated LLVM IR.
- Build stamp invalidates the cache when `NX_NOMEMO` or `NX_CFLAGS`
  change, so a flag flip rebuilds instead of reusing a stale binary.
- CI now checks that unboxed and `NX_NOUNBOX` builds produce identical
  output.

- Windows MSI installer (PATH + bundled VS Code extension)
- `nx update` also updates the VS Code extension

## v0.0.2
- `nx update` self-updater (`nx update --version <ver>` to pin)
- `nx --version` / `nx --license` (MIT embedded in exe)
- Raw `nx` binaries per release (no more zips)

## v0.0.1
- Initial interpreter: lexer, parser, tree-walk `nx file.nx`
- Indent blocks, `if/elif/else`, `while`, `for i in a..b` + `for x in list`
- `fn` + `return` + recursion, scopes
- Lists, indexing incl. negative, `len()`, `push()`
